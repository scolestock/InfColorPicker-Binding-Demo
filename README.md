# InfColorPicker-Binding-Demo
Demo code for May 2015 MNEM talk

This code was created as part of a presentation I recently gave to the Minnesota Enteprise Mobility user group - http://www.meetup.com/Minnesota-Enterprise-Mobile/events/221910132/

The idea was to demonstrate how binding libraries and custom renderers can come together - in this case, showing the InfColorPicker iOS library that Xamarin uses
when demonstrating the iOS binding library process -- and how that library can be represented in a Xamarin Forms app with a 
custom view that has interesting bindable properties.
